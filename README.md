# keymaps

This repository contains keymaps that aim to replicate the feel of other editors.

## Installation

At this time, Zed does not have a built-in keymap switcher, so you must either:
- Copy and paste the contents of the new keymap over your existing one (Command Palette > `zed::OpenKeymap`)
- Overwrite the current keymap by dropping the new `keymap.json` file into `~/.config/zed/`

## Issues and pull requests

Issues for the `keymaps` repository can be found [here](https://github.com/zed-industries/feedback/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Akeymaps).

Feel free to open a pull request to:
- Fix an issue for an existing keymap
- Add a new keymap

## Things to note

- Some functionality may be missing in these keymaps, as Zed may not currently support the action or may not have a way to represent it with a customizable keybinding
- Keymaps are not one of our main priorities at this time, but we will add and update them as we are able. We welcome pull requests to help with this effort.
